# Literature Review: [Smart Precision Weeding In Agriculture Using 5IR Technologies]

> Status: Under Faculty Review (Pending Submission)

## Overview

This repository includes the draft of the literature review paper which examines how emerging Fifth Industrial Revolution (5IR) technologies—such as AI, robotics, and IoT—are reshaping weed control in agriculture through smart precision weeding systems. 
It outlines recent progress in automation and real-time data analysis, which are helping to reduce chemical use, boost operational efficiency, and promote sustainable farming. The paper also discusses ongoing challenges like data reliability, farmer adoption, and infrastructure limitations. By analyzing current trends and innovations, it emphasizes the transformative potential of 5IR-driven solutions in modern agriculture. Future considerations include the importance of supportive policies, cross-disciplinary efforts, and government involvement to accelerate widespread implementation.
